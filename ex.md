1.  **What is the purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis?** The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to investigate the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the risk of gastric cancer.
    
2.  **What were the main findings of this study?** The main findings of this study were that there was no statistical evidence of an association between PPIs and gastric cancer when considering studies that addressed confounding in a comprehensive manner. The certainty in the summary effect estimate was low.
    
3.  **Why did the authors focus on studies using H2 receptor agonists (H2RAs) as the comparator group?** The authors focused on studies using H2RAs as the comparator group because they may be at similar risk of developing gastric cancer with respect to those exposed to PPIs. This choice was motivated by epidemiological considerations, as exposure to PPIs may be associated with several known and unknown prognostic factors for gastric cancer, making it difficult to comprehensively handle confounding when using unexposed individuals as the comparator group.
    
4.  **What were the limitations of this study?** The limitations of this study included the fact that the evidence was of low certainty, as non-randomized studies are prone to residual and unmeasured confounding. Additionally, the rarity of the event made it difficult to perform exceptionally large and lengthy randomized trials that would be needed to provide reliable estimates.
    
5.  **What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice?** These findings suggest that PPIs may result in trivial to no difference in the risk of gastric cancer. However, due to the low certainty of the evidence, further research is needed to confirm these findings.
